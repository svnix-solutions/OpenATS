# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenATS are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Releases through v0.4.0 were published only on GitHub; they are reproduced here
so the history lives in the repository. See
[docs-draft/GA_ROADMAP.md](docs-draft/GA_ROADMAP.md) for what is planned next.

## [Unreleased]

OpenATS became multi-tenant. An organization is a recruiting agency, the
companies it recruits for are client companies, and contacts at those companies
can sign in to see their own roles. Everything below follows from that, and
most of the fixes are places where the tenancy boundary did not reach.

### Added

- Multi-tenancy: every table carries an `organization_id` under a forced
  row-level security policy, so a query written without thinking about tenancy
  returns nothing rather than the wrong thing. The application connects as a
  least-privileged role, because owners and superusers bypass those policies.
- Client companies, with CRUD and a settings screen. Jobs belong to one, and
  each has its own careers page at `/careers/:slug`.
- A client portal: contacts see their own company's jobs and candidates, with
  the agency's working view withheld — contact details, CV scoring, internal
  rejection notes.
- `candidates` is now a person and `applications` is one person's submission to
  one job, so the same person applying twice is two submissions.
- Roles and client-company assignment are set from Settings → User Management
  and read from the database, not the token.
- Per-agency email branding, structured JSON logging, and Sentry error
  reporting — all three stamped with the organization they came from.
- The whole application runs in Docker: `docker compose --profile app up`.
- Rollback: deploys keep their build tarball, and `scripts/rollback.sh` puts a
  previous one back without a rebuild.
- Deployment, configuration and upgrade guides in `docs-draft/`.

### Security

- Dashboard socket events went to a single global room that every
  authenticated socket joined, so every organization received every other
  organization's activity — job and candidate ids included. Rooms are now
  per-organization.
- One organization's departments were cached under a global key and served to
  every other organization for five minutes.
- Candidate contact details reached client contacts through the offers,
  interviews and assessment-results endpoints, which bypassed the redaction
  applied to the candidate endpoints.
- A client role with no client company fell through every scoping rule and saw
  the agency's whole book of business. It is refused at sign-in.
- The origin check on `/public/*` was mounted before the tenant was resolved,
  read an empty list, treated that as "not configured" and allowed everything.
- Candidate-facing assessment and interview routes were also mounted under
  `/api`, where they ran as whichever staff member was signed in, without rate
  limiting or the client check.
- The login page shipped hardcoded demo credentials; they are now opt-in
  through environment variables.
- Socket chat payloads are validated: an unbounded `text` column previously
  accepted anything up to Socket.IO's 1 MB frame.
- Every high-severity dependency advisory cleared (16 → 0).

### Fixed

- Client companies could not be created at all, so no job could be created
  through the product on a fresh install.
- Job creation silently discarded the client company it was given, so an
  agency with more than one client could not create a job.
- Assessment time limits are minutes, but the candidate's timer read them as
  seconds — a two-hour assessment gave two minutes and then submitted itself.
- The Google OAuth callback ran outside any tenancy context, so the connection
  it wrote was always refused and Google Meet could not be connected.
- Sending an offer marked it sent before the email went out, leaving the row
  and the API disagreeing when sending failed.
- Client contacts landed on a candidate section hidden from them.

### Changed

- CI builds the backend once and the deploy ships that exact artifact; the
  production VM no longer compiles.
- `next` 16.1.6 → 16.3.2.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-13

This release fixes what was broken rather than adding features. The headline is
that Socket.IO was completely unauthenticated: anyone who could reach the server
could read every hiring team's chat and write messages as any user. That is
closed, along with the rest of the authorization gaps around it.

### Security

- Socket.IO connections now require a valid Asgardeo JWT in the handshake,
  verified before any handler runs. Previously sockets accepted any connection
  with `cors: "*"`, so an anonymous client could write chat messages
  impersonating any user.
- `senderId` on socket writes is taken from the verified token rather than the
  client payload.
- Room joins (`join_job`, `join_candidate`) are authorized against hiring-team
  membership, and the chat write handlers require the socket to already be in
  the room, so a client cannot skip the join and write to an arbitrary job.
- Dashboard broadcasts go to a `staff` room instead of `io.emit()`, so
  candidate pipeline movements, offers, and interviews are no longer sent to
  every connected client.
- Socket tokens are re-fetched on every connect attempt, so reconnects survive
  token expiry instead of silently dropping realtime updates until a refresh.
- `GET /chat/job/:jobId` and `/chat/candidate/:candidateId` are gated on
  hiring-team membership; they previously returned any conversation to any
  authenticated user.
- The authenticated API is rate limited, keyed by user id rather than IP so an
  office behind one NAT does not share a budget. Tunable with `RATE_LIMIT_API`
  and `RATE_LIMIT_EXPENSIVE`.

### Added

- Automated tests for authentication (`tests/integration/auth.test.ts`), covering
  expired, wrong-issuer and wrongly-signed tokens, the claim checks, user
  provisioning, and the auth middleware. Only the JWKS fetch is mocked, so
  signatures, `exp` and `iss` are genuinely verified.
- Automated tests for the core hiring flow
  (`tests/integration/core-flows.test.ts`): apply, duplicate application, stage
  move, interview scheduling, and the offer draft-to-send path, driven through
  the real HTTP API with a signed token.
- Frontend unit tests, using a separate Vitest install in `frontend/` with jsdom
  and Testing Library. `pnpm test` at the root now runs backend and frontend
  tests in turn.
- Coverage reporting: `pnpm test:coverage` produces text, HTML and lcov reports
  for the backend.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Fixed

- **A partial `PATCH /api/offers/:id` silently wiped the offer's start date.**
  Every other field was passed through untouched when omitted, but `startDate`
  was normalized to `null` first, and the helper that drops unset fields only
  drops `undefined`. Editing any other field on a draft offer erased the start
  date, after which the offer could not be sent ("Missing required fields:
  startDate").
- `tsconfig.test.json` inherited `"exclude": ["tests"]` from the base config and
  therefore type-checked nothing. A deliberate type error had been sitting in
  `object.util.test.ts` undetected.
- Eleven `catch` blocks returned 500 while discarding the error; they now log it.
- `job.service.update` stringified salary values while `create` passed numbers,
  disagreeing with the schema's `.$type<number>()`.
- `useAttemptResults` declared assessment question types that do not exist
  (`single_choice`, `text`), so the assessment results sheet could never match a
  short or long answer question. All question types now come from one
  definition matching the database enum.
- `CandidateInterview` was missing five fields the API returns, including the
  `stageType` the interview card renders a colour dot from.
- `InterviewListItem.status` was typed as nullable although the column is
  `NOT NULL`, and `fmtTime` was called with a nullable `scheduledAt`.

### Changed

- The backend has an ESLint config and a `lint` script, and passes with zero
  problems. `no-explicit-any` is enforced as an error: all 108 uses were
  removed, mostly `catch (e: any)` and `(e as any).message`, replaced by
  narrowed helpers in `utils/error.utils.ts`.
- The frontend's `any` uses were removed the same way, replacing them with the
  types that already existed in `types/index.ts`.
- The frontend's remaining lint errors are fixed, so `pnpm lint` at the repo
  root now passes and can be used as a CI gate. Two `react-hooks` cases keep a
  scoped `eslint-disable` with the reason written next to it, because the state
  they touch cannot legally move into render.
- `worker.ts` calls `validateEnv()` on boot, matching the API, so it can no
  longer start with broken configuration and fail later at job time.
- CI gates backend lint and type-checks the backend test files.
- Removed the unused `components/ui/carousel.tsx` shadcn primitive.

### Known issues

- 54 dependency advisories are open (15 high), almost all reached through
  `next@16.1.6`. The upgrade is deliberately held until immediately before the
  v1.0.0 release so the version bump is as fresh as possible.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Email template builder rebuilt on a Tiptap rich-text editor, replacing the
  block-based builder.
- `make asgardeo` (or `./setup-asgardeo.sh`) creates the `super_admin`,
  `hiring_manager`, and `interviewer` roles in an Asgardeo tenant through an M2M
  application and writes the role IDs into `backend/.env`.
- The backend validates every required environment variable on boot and exits
  with a clear list of what is missing or invalid.
- `/health` queries Postgres and pings Redis, returning 503 when either is
  unreachable. It previously only confirmed the process was alive.
- Free-text answers are shown in the assessment results sheet (#37).
- Project logo.

### Fixed

- Login failed for existing users whose Asgardeo user ID changed. The lookup is
  keyed on the `sub` claim, and when that changed the lookup missed and creating
  a replacement user hit the unique email constraint.
- Any exception during authentication returned 401, so database failures looked
  identical to bad tokens. Only genuine token errors return 401 now.
- `logger.error("failed:", err)` printed only the first argument, dropping the
  actual error, at 41 call sites.
- The backend did not compile: two versions of `ioredis` were installed,
  producing two incompatible `Redis` types.
- View CV downloaded the file instead of previewing it (#35).
- The candidate delete dialog uses the shared dialog component (#38).

### Performance

- Migration `0027` adds indexes on `jobs.department_id`, `jobs.created_by`,
  `job_hiring_team.user_id`, `offers.job_id`, `offers.created_by`,
  `interview_feedback.interview_id`, and `interview_feedback.author_id`.

### Changed

- `backend/` and `frontend/` are packages in one pnpm workspace with a single
  root lockfile.
- Backend code is grouped under `src/modules/<feature>/`; the top-level
  `controllers/` and `services/` folders are gone. No behaviour changed.
- Vitest for unit and integration tests, Playwright for end-to-end tests,
  against a dedicated test database on port 5433.
- CI runs tests, a type check, and a backend build on every pull request, using
  no secrets so pull requests from forks work.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` had 91 lines accidentally deleted and ended mid-sentence;
  restored and updated.

### Upgrade notes

- **Node.js 22 or higher is now required** (previously 18).
- Dependencies install from the repo root. When upgrading an existing checkout:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules backend/node_modules frontend/node_modules
  rm -f backend/pnpm-lock.yaml frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml
  pnpm install
  ```
- Local Postgres is now version 17. An existing volume from 16 or earlier will
  not start against it: either recreate it (`docker compose down -v`, which
  deletes local data) or point `DATABASE_URL` at your existing database.
- `docker-compose.yml` moved to the repo root from `backend/`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Per-user Google Meet integration. Interviewers connect their own Google
  account from Settings → Integrations over OAuth 2.0; tokens are encrypted at
  rest with AES-256-GCM and refreshed automatically.
- Auto-generated Meet links when a candidate confirms a time slot, created on
  the interviewer's own calendar with the candidate invited.
- Interviews have an assigned interviewer, used as the Meet/calendar event owner.
- Double-booking prevention: allocated slots are flagged in the scheduler, shown
  as "Unavailable" to candidates, and enforced server-side with a race-safe
  claim returning 409 on conflict.
- Rebuilt scheduler dialog, candidate-facing pages, and interview emails,
  including a new cancellation email.
- Deleting an interview cancels the provider Meet event, removes the calendar
  event, and emails the candidate.

### Fixed

- Event template save silently failed (payload builder argument mismatch).
- Candidate confirmation email was never sent: a dead duplicate route shadowed
  the real public handler.
- Candidates list, interview status, offers, and stage moves update live over a
  single dashboard-wide socket instead of requiring a page reload.
- Moving a candidate to the stage they are already in no longer re-triggers
  automations.
- Calendar event creation failed silently when inviting attendees via a service
  account without Domain-Wide Delegation. Attendees are now listed in the event
  description unless `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ALLOW_ATTENDEES=true`.
- "Mark as Hired" no longer stays active after hiring; draft offers appear on
  the profile without a reload.

### Upgrade notes

- New `backend/.env` variables: `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`,
  `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` (redirect URI must
  be `<backend-url>/oauth/google/callback`, HTTPS in production),
  `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (`openssl rand -base64 32`, fresh per environment), and the
  optional `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ALLOW_ATTENDEES`.
- Two new migrations. Run `pnpm drizzle-kit migrate` outside the deploy workflow.
- Enable the Google Calendar API and configure the OAuth consent screen with the
  `calendar.events` scope.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- The company logo was wiped whenever the profile form was saved after an
  upload: the save request omitted `logoUrl`, so the backend reset it to null.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Role-based access control across frontend and backend.
- CV analysis runs on a background job queue (BullMQ + Redis) instead of
  fire-and-forget.
- Redesigned public careers page with job status management
  (publish/deactivate/close), company header, and search/department filters.
- Pagination and bulk actions for jobs, offers, templates, and candidates.
- Interview token expiry and application confirmation emails.
- Realtime candidate profile updates for offers, interviews, and assessments.
- Local Postgres and Redis via docker-compose for development.

### Fixed

- Pipeline drag-and-drop snap-back and double-trigger.
- Search double-fetch and debounce tuning.
- User provisioning and SCIM2 integration.
- Interview slot page crash.
- Assessment N+1 queries and caching.
- Company logo upload silently failing to render (R2 content-disposition).

### Security

- Rate limiting on public endpoints.
- Removed PII from debug logs and hardened public upload validation.
- Fixed raw error exposure to clients.
- Indexes on foreign key and lookup columns.
