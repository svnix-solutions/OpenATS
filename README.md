## What this is

Recruiting often means juggling spreadsheets, inboxes, and a handful of disconnected
tools. OpenATS brings job creation, candidate tracking, interviews, and hiring
decisions into one workspace teams can set up as their own internal hiring platform.

Many recruitment tools are hard to customize and expensive to scale. OpenATS is a
flexible open-source alternative: use it as a ready-to-go hiring platform, or as the
foundation for building your own internal recruitment system - with full ownership of
the code, the data, and the workflow, instead of adapting your process to fit someone
else's software.

OpenATS provides:

- Full ownership through open-source software
- Flexible and customizable hiring workflows
- A foundation for building internal recruitment platforms
- Reduced dependence on proprietary ATS vendors
- Improved collaboration across hiring teams

## Everything you need to hire better

From job creation to candidate evaluation and hiring decisions, OpenATS provides the
tools your team needs to build a faster, more organized recruitment process.

**Job Management**
Create, organize, and manage job openings with structured requirements, departments,
and hiring workflows.

**Candidate Tracking**
Track applicants through every stage of the hiring process with a clear and
customizable recruitment pipeline.

**Interview Management**
Schedule interviews, collect feedback, and keep everyone aligned throughout the
candidate evaluation process.

**AI Resume Parsing**
Automatically extract and organize candidate information from resumes to save time
and reduce manual work - run as a background job so a slow AI call never blocks a
candidate-facing page.

**Team Collaboration**
Collaborate on hiring decisions with shared feedback, candidate reviews, and
streamlined communication.

**Career Page Builder**
Build a career page that showcases opportunities and attracts the right candidates to
your organization.

## The stack

Two independent packages - not a monorepo, no shared `package.json` or lockfile.

## Quick start

You need Node.js 22+, Docker, and pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chamals3n4/OpenATS.git && cd OpenATS

cd backend
docker compose up -d          # Postgres on :5432, Redis on :6379
cp .env.example .env          # fill in ASGARDEO_*, R2_*, RESEND_*, GEMINI_API_KEY
pnpm install
pnpm drizzle-kit generate && pnpm drizzle-kit migrate
pnpm tsx src/db/seed.ts       # required: seeds the 5 default pipeline stages
pnpm dev                      # API on :8080
```

In a second terminal, the CV analysis worker (its own process, separate from the API):

```sh
cd backend
pnpm dev:worker
```

In a third terminal:

```sh
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env          # fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_ASGARDEO_*, OPENATS_API_URL
pnpm install
pnpm dev                      # app on :3000
```

Full walkthrough, including how to set up your own Asgardeo application, is in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration

Each package reads its own `.env` - there's no shared root env file.

**`backend/.env`**

| Variable                                             | What it's for                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`                                       | Postgres connection string                                      |
| `REDIS_URL`                                          | Redis, for the CV analysis job queue                            |
| `ASGARDEO_JWKS_URL` / `ASGARDEO_ISSUER`              | JWT verification - required for almost every route              |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY`                                     | Encrypts stored integration credentials                         |
| `FRONTEND_URL`                                       | Used for CORS and links in outbound emails                      |
| `R2_*`                                               | Cloudflare R2 (or compatible) object storage for uploaded files |
| `RESEND_*`                                           | Transactional email                                             |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`                                     | Powers CV parsing, scoring, and AI summaries                    |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` / `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID` | Optional - interview scheduling via a Google service account    |

**`frontend/.env`**

| Variable                                  | What it's for                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ASGARDEO_*` / `ASGARDEO_*`   | Sign-in against the same Asgardeo application as the backend   |
| `OPENATS_API_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Where the backend is reachable from the server and the browser |

Optional too: `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` (the owner role, read only by drizzle-kit),
`LOG_LEVEL`, `SENTRY_DSN` and friends, `RATE_LIMIT_*`, and the Google Meet OAuth
credentials.

Startup fails fast with a clear message if a required backend variable is missing,
rather than crashing later on the first request that needs it. Optional variables
are not validated, so a typo in one is silent.

**[docs-draft/CONFIGURATION.md](./docs-draft/CONFIGURATION.md) is the complete
reference** — every variable both packages read, which are required, and what
the defaults are.

## Running it all in Docker

```bash
docker compose --profile app up -d --build
```

API, worker, frontend, Postgres and Redis. Without `--profile app` you get
Postgres and Redis only — unchanged, and still what local development uses.

Both `.env` files are required, and a first run needs an organization created
and seeded before the app is usable. See
[docs-draft/DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs-draft/DEPLOYMENT.md#running-the-whole-thing-in-docker).

## Architecture

**[docs-draft/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs-draft/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — how the pieces
fit, why the tenancy boundary is in the database rather than the application,
and which parts are replaceable.

Identity is one of them. The backend needs an OIDC provider, not Asgardeo
specifically: **[docs-draft/IDENTITY_PROVIDERS.md](./docs-draft/IDENTITY_PROVIDERS.md)**
has a verified recipe for running self-hosted
[authorizer.dev](https://authorizer.dev) instead, and what to check for any
other provider.

## Deploying

See **[docs-draft/DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs-draft/DEPLOYMENT.md)** for the full
guide, and **[docs-draft/UPGRADING.md](./docs-draft/UPGRADING.md)** for moving
an existing install forward.

In short: pushing to `main` deploys the backend to an Azure VM, but only if the
test suite passes. CI builds `backend/dist` and ships that exact tarball — the
VM does not compile, because compiling there produced an artifact from whatever
toolchain that box happened to have rather than the one CI tested.

The frontend is a standard Next.js app and is not deployed by that workflow.

Two things that bite on a first deploy:

- `DATABASE_URL` must be the least-privileged `openats_app` role. Owners and
  superusers **bypass row-level security**, so pointing it at the owner turns
  multi-tenancy off silently — every query still works and nothing is filtered.
- `ecosystem.config.js` is not in this repository. It lives on the VM, and the
  deploy restarts pm2 against it.
